---

## services.meduseld.io — The Great Hall (Main Hub)

File: `meduseld-site/services/index.html`

Central navigation hub. All service cards check live status via a Cloudflare Worker health API at `https://meduseld-health.404-41f.workers.dev`. The worker first checks Cloudflare Tunnel health via the Cloudflare API, then performs individual service checks only if the tunnel is healthy. Status checks run every 5 seconds.

### Navigation & Global Elements

- "← Back to Landing" button → navigates to `https://meduseld.io`
- "Changelog" button → opens a modal with two tabs (Site and Backend). Fetches CHANGELOG.md from each GitHub repo (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) on first open, renders markdown to styled HTML. Shows spinner while loading, error message on failure.
- Discord widget (Widgetbot Crate) → embedded chat bubble in bottom-right, links to server channel `1474674474036232204`
- Speech bubble notification → appears after 3 seconds, fades after 8 seconds, says "Server suggestion or problem? Send a Discord message!"
- Profile widget (top-right, inside header nav bar) → shows avatar, display name, and Admin badge for admins. Dropdown includes: username, role, "My Profile" link (links to `https://profile.meduseld.io`), "Admin Panel" link (admin only, links to `https://admin.meduseld.io`), and Logout (redirects to `https://meduseld.io`)
- Calendar widget (centered, between page title and news panel) → shows upcoming group events fetched from `health.meduseld.io/check/calendar` (proxied through health to bypass Cloudflare Access). Displays event title, date/time, and optional description. Each event has RSVP buttons (going/maybe/not going) with counts — clicking sets your status, clicking the same status again removes it, hovering shows names of users who selected that option. Admins see a "+" button to add events (opens modal with title, date/time, description fields), edit buttons (pencil icon, opens edit modal pre-filled with event data), and delete buttons on each event. Events auto-load on page load. Auth via `cf_token` query param (GET/DELETE) or `_cf_token` in JSON body (POST/PUT).
- FellowSync active room banner (centered, between page title and calendar widget) → polls `health.meduseld.io/check/fellowsync-rooms` every 30 seconds (proxied to FellowSync backend at `127.0.0.1:5050/api/rooms/active`). When one or more listening rooms are active, shows a clickable card with the FellowSync icon, room count, total listener count badge, and currently playing track/artist. When a single room is active, links directly to that room (`https://fellowsync.meduseld.io/room/<room_id>`) and shows the sync/group ID as a clickable badge (click to copy with tooltip feedback). Displays `group_id` from the API response if available, falls back to `room_id`. When multiple rooms are active, links to `https://fellowsync.meduseld.io` and hides the code badge. Hidden when no rooms are active. No authentication required.
- Copyright footer with quietarcade link and dynamic version badge (fetches latest release from GitHub API, links to release page)

### Service Cards (Active)

Each active service card has a status indicator badge that shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Offline with color coding (green/red/orange). When the Cloudflare tunnel is down, the service button becomes a link to `https://status.meduseld.io` instead of being disabled.

1. **Icarus Server (Game Server Panel)**
   - Status badge: checks panel health, shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Tunnel Down
   - "Open Control Panel" button → links to `https://panel.meduseld.io` (disabled when offline, links to status page when tunnel is down)
   - Production/Development mode toggle badge → currently hidden. When visible, click to switch between `panel.meduseld.io` and `panel.meduseld.io?env=development`. Persists in localStorage as `panelDevMode`. Shows a toast notification on toggle.
   - Game name and description are dynamically set from `CONFIG.gameName` (currently "Icarus")

2. **Edoras (Jellyfin/Media)**
   - Status badge: checks Jellyfin health via Cloudflare Worker health API, shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Tunnel Down
   - "Open Edoras" button → opens a modal with options (disabled when offline, links to status page when tunnel is down):
     - "View Library" → calls `/api/jellyfin-auth` to auto-provision a Jellyfin account and get an auth token, then navigates (same tab) to `jellyfin.meduseld.io/sso-login` which sets localStorage credentials and opens Jellyfin logged in. Falls back to navigating to Jellyfin directly if auth fails. Shows "Connecting..." spinner during auth.
     - "Request" button → calls `openSeerr()` which navigates to `health.meduseld.io/check/seerr-auth?cf_token=<token>`. The backend provisions the user's Jellyfin account, authenticates against Jellyseerr's API with those credentials, sets the `connect.sid` session cookie on `.meduseld.io`, and redirects to `https://requests.meduseld.io` (user arrives logged in).
     - "Manage" button (admin only) → links to `https://edoras.meduseld.io` Edoras management page. Shows gold "Admin" badge.
   - Description: "Stream movies, TV shows, and media from our Edoras server."
   - SSO login page (`/sso-login`): uses an iframe-first approach to avoid a race condition where Jellyfin's ConnectionManager overwrites localStorage credentials. Loads `/web/index.html` in a hidden iframe, polls localStorage every 250ms until Jellyfin initializes `jellyfin_credentials` with `Servers[0].Id`, then patches in `AccessToken`/`UserId` and redirects. Falls back to direct credential write after 15 seconds.
   - Direct visit auto-login: when a user visits `jellyfin.meduseld.io` directly with a valid `CF_Authorization` cookie, an injected script automatically calls `/api/jellyfin-auth`, then polls localStorage waiting for Jellyfin's ConnectionManager to initialize credentials before patching in the auth token. Uses `sessionStorage` flag to prevent retry loops (one attempt per session).

3. **FellowSync (Spotify Listening Rooms)**
   - Custom icon: `fellowsync-bi.png`
   - "Open FellowSync" button → links to `https://fellowsync.meduseld.io`
   - Description: "One does not simply listen alone..."
   - No status badge (external app, not health-checked)

4. **The Red Book (E-books & Audiobooks)**
   - "Open The Red Book" button → links to `https://redbook.meduseld.io`
   - Description: "Browse and listen to e-books and audiobooks from our collection."
   - No status badge (external app, not health-checked)

5. **Trivia Game**
   - "Play Trivia" button → links to `https://trivia.meduseld.io`
   - Description: "Test your knowledge with trivia questions."
   - No status badge (static page, not health-checked)

6. **Game Picker**
   - "Open Game Picker" button → links to `https://picker.meduseld.io`
   - Description: "Spin the wheel to pick this week's party game."
   - No status badge (static page, not health-checked)

7. **Remote Desktop**
   - "Open Remote Desktop" button → links to `https://remote.meduseld.io`
   - Description: "Share and control each other's screens for remote collaboration."
   - No status badge (WebRTC peer-to-peer, not health-checked)

8. **Hall of Fame**
   - "Open Hall of Fame" button → links to `https://fame.meduseld.io`
   - Description: "Funny moments, clips, and memorable screenshots from our adventures."
   - No status badge (static page, not health-checked)
   - "Under Construction" badge shown on the card
   - Button is admin-gated: admins see "Open Hall of Fame", non-admins see disabled "Coming Soon" button. Toggled via `showAdminCards()` in JS.

### Service Cards (Coming Soon — Disabled)

- Games sorted by weighted vote score (Borda count) when votes exist, otherwise creation order
- "Vote" button (thumbs-up icon) → enters vote mode where users can drag-and-drop to rank games by preference (#1 = most wanted). Shows instruction bar with Save/Cancel buttons. Requires authentication.
- Vote mode initializes with user's existing rankings if they've voted before, otherwise uses current display order
- "Save Votes" → PUT to `health.meduseld.io/check/game-votes` with `{rankings: {appId: rank}}`. Replaces all previous votes for that user. Each user gets one set of rankings (unique constraint per user+game).
- Scoring: Borda count — rank 1 = 7 points, rank 2 = 6, ..., rank 7 = 1 point. Games sorted by total score descending, vote count as tiebreaker.
- Vote count badges shown next to each game (thumbs-up icon + count). Hovering shows voter names and their rank for that game via Bootstrap tooltip.
- Total voter count badge shown in card header.
- Backend: `GameVote` model (`game_votes` table) with `user_id`, `game_app_id`, `rank`, `updated_at`. Unique constraint on `(user_id, game_app_id)`.
- "Refresh prices" button → re-fetches prices from Steam API with `forceRefresh=true`

  - Gold: idle shutdown events, Wine errors (only err: level, warn: and fixme: filtered out)
  - Gray: process health checks, expected process monitor messages (after user stop/kill/idle shutdown)
- Visual separators for: SERVER START, SERVER STOP INITIATED, SERVER STOPPED, IDLE SHUTDOWN, SERVER KILLED, SERVER CRASHED, PROCESS DIED UNEXPECTEDLY
- The stop, kill, and idle shutdown actions write markers to `startup.log` ("User stop:", "User kill:", "Idle shutdown:") so the panel can distinguish intentional shutdowns from unexpected process deaths. When the process monitor detects the server is gone, it checks the preceding log lines for these markers — if found, the event is shown as a quiet gray line; if not, it shows the red "💥 PROCESS DIED UNEXPECTEDLY" separator.

### CPU & RAM Charts

## admin.meduseld.io — User Management (Admin Only)

File: `meduseld-site/admin/index.html`

Static admin page for managing user roles and account status. Served by Cloudflare Pages independently of the Flask backend. Non-admin users are redirected to `services.meduseld.io?restricted=user-management`.

### Navigation

- "Back to Services" button → navigates to `https://services.meduseld.io`
- Profile widget (top-right, inside header nav bar)

### Users Table

- Fetches from `GET https://panel.meduseld.io/api/admin/users` with credentials
- "Refresh" button → re-fetches user list
- Columns: User (avatar + display name), Discord ID, Role, Services, Trivia, Last Login, Actions
- Services column shows a purple Jellyfin icon if the user has Jellyfin credentials (`has_jellyfin`), dash otherwise
- Trivia column shows a gold badge with games played count and accuracy percentage. Hovering shows a Bootstrap tooltip with full stats: games played, total correct, total wrong, best single-game score, and accuracy %. Users with no trivia games show a dash.
- Current user row shows a "You" badge
- Inactive users shown at 50% opacity
- Users sorted: admins first, then alphabetically by display name
- Users without a custom Discord avatar show Discord's default avatar (colored Discord logo) instead of a generic icon

### Actions Per User (not available on own account)

- Promote/Demote button → `PUT /api/admin/users/<id>` with `{role: "admin"}` or `{role: "user"}`
- Activate/Deactivate button → `PUT /api/admin/users/<id>` with `{is_active: true}` or `{is_active: false}`
- Toast notifications on success/failure

### Backend Offline State

- If the Flask backend is unreachable, the table shows "Backend is offline. Unable to load users."
- User count badge shows "Backend Offline" in red
- If the `CF_Authorization` cookie is invalid or expired (401/403), shows "Authentication failed" with a suggestion to log out and back in. User count badge shows "Auth Error" in yellow.
- API calls are routed through `health.meduseld.io/check/team-roster` to bypass Cloudflare Access session requirements. The endpoint is named "team-roster" instead of "admin-users" to avoid ad-blocker false positives (filter lists block URLs containing "admin"). Auth is handled by reading the `CF_Authorization` cookie via JS and passing its value as a `cf_token` query parameter (GET) or `_cf_token` in the JSON body (PUT). This avoids both Cloudflare cookie interception and CORS preflight issues. Flask's `_authenticate_from_cookie()` decodes the token from cookie, header, query param, body, or form data.

### Admin Tools Section

Below the users table, an "Admin Tools" section displays service cards for admin-only services. These were moved here from the services page since they are only relevant to admins.

1. **SSH Access**
   - Status badge: checks SSH health via Cloudflare Worker health API (`https://meduseld-health.404-41f.workers.dev`), polls every 5 seconds
   - Shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Tunnel Down with color coding (green/red/orange)
   - "Open SSH Terminal" button → links to `https://ssh.meduseld.io` (disabled when offline, links to status page when tunnel is down)

## trivia.meduseld.io — Trivia Game

File: `meduseld-site/trivia/index.html`

Multiplayer trivia game with lobby system using WebSocket (Flask-SocketIO). Users can host or join lobbies to play together in real-time, or play solo. Questions from Open Trivia Database API. Only multiplayer game results are recorded to the backend leaderboard; solo games are untracked and just for fun.

### Navigation

- "Back to Services" button → navigates to `https://services.meduseld.io`
- Profile widget (top-right, inside header nav bar)

### Leaderboard (Podium)

- Fetches aggregated win data from `GET https://health.meduseld.io/check/trivia-leaderboard`
- Top 3 users displayed as podium cards with medal emojis (🥇🥈🥉), avatar, display name, and win count
- Users ranked 4+ shown in a table below the podium
- Refreshes automatically after each multiplayer game completes

### Lobby Browser (default view)

- "Host Game" button → opens create lobby form
- "Join by Code" button → prompts for a 6-character lobby code
- "Play Solo" button → opens solo game setup (no WebSocket needed)
- Refresh button → re-fetches active lobbies from `GET https://health.meduseld.io/check/trivia-lobbies`
- Lobby cards show: host name, lobby code, player count/max, question count, difficulty, category. Clicking a card joins the lobby.

### Create Lobby Form

- Questions: dropdown (5, 10, 15, 20 — default 10)
- Difficulty: dropdown (Any, Easy, Medium, Hard — default Any). Disabled when Country Flags category is selected.
- Max Players: dropdown (2–12, default 8)
- Category: dropdown loaded dynamically from `https://opentdb.com/api_category.php`, plus a custom "🏳️ Country Flags" option at the top
- "Create Lobby" button → connects WebSocket to `panel.meduseld.io/trivia` namespace, emits `create_lobby` event

### Lobby Waiting Room

- Shows lobby code (with Bootstrap tooltip "Share this code with friends"), game settings summary
- Player chips with avatars, display names, HOST badge for the host
- Host can kick players (X icon on each non-host player chip, only visible during waiting)
- Host sees "Start Game" button. Non-hosts see "Waiting for host to start..."
- "Leave" button → emits `leave_lobby`, returns to browser. If host leaves, lobby closes for all players.
- Real-time updates via WebSocket: `player_joined`, `player_left` events update the player list

### WebSocket Connection

- Connects to `panel.meduseld.io` on the `/trivia` namespace
- Auth: passes `CF_Authorization` cookie value as `token` query parameter
- Server authenticates by decoding the JWT and looking up the user by Discord ID
- On connect, server emits `welcome` with `{user_id}` (DB user ID) so the client can identify itself in lobby data
- Transports: WebSocket with polling fallback

### Multiplayer Gameplay

- Host clicks "Start Game" → server fetches questions from Open Trivia DB (or REST Countries API for flags), emits `game_starting` with countdown (5 seconds)
- Countdown displayed as large animated number with category badge (if a specific category was selected)
- Each question delivered via `question` event with shuffled answers and 20-second time limit
- Timer bar animates from full (gold) → yellow (50%) → red (25%) → empty
- For standard questions: answer buttons use `data-idx` attributes and click event listeners (avoids HTML entity escaping issues with inline onclick). Clicking an answer: disables all buttons, highlights selection, emits `submit_answer` with the raw answer string.
- For flag questions: displays flag image with a text input field. Player types country name and clicks submit (or presses Enter). Input is disabled after submission.
- `player_answered` event updates player chips (green border = answered)
- Player chips show live scores next to display names during gameplay (visible once the game is in playing or results state)
- When all players answer (or timer expires), server emits `answer_reveal` with correct answer and per-player results
- Standard questions: correct answer highlighted green, wrong answers red. Flag questions: correct country name shown below the flag, input field colored green (correct) or red (wrong).
- "Everyone's answers" section shown below the answer reveal: lists each player's guess with correct (green check), wrong (red X), or no answer (gray clock) icons, color-coded answer text, and a "You" badge for the current user
- Score badge updates. Progress dots update.
- 5-second pause between questions, then next question auto-advances
- After final question, server emits `game_over` with standings sorted by score
- Host sees an "End Game" button in the question header. Clicking it (with confirm dialog) ends the game early — shows standings but no stats are recorded to the leaderboard. Server emits `game_aborted` instead of `game_over`.

### Sudden Death Tiebreaker

When the regular game ends with two or more players tied for first place, sudden death begins automatically instead of going to results.

- Server emits `sudden_death` event with the tied players' info and their shared score
- 4-second dramatic announcement screen: crossed swords emoji, "Sudden Death" heading, player names ("X vs Y"), tied score, and contextual message (dueling players see "First mistake loses", spectators see "You're spectating")
- Server fetches up to 10 extra questions from the same category/difficulty settings
- Only the tied players can submit answers — all other players see a "Spectating" badge and have their inputs disabled (buttons disabled + reduced opacity, flag input disabled with "Spectating..." placeholder)
- Question cards switch to red theme (red border, red header background, red timer bar) with "⚔️ Sudden Death" badge. Header shows "Sudden Death Round X" instead of question number.
- End Game button is hidden during sudden death
- Progress dots are hidden during sudden death
- Elimination: when at least one dueling player answers correctly and at least one answers wrong, the wrong players are eliminated. Survivors get +1 score to pull ahead in standings.
- If all dueling players answer correctly or all answer wrong, the round continues with no elimination
- Not answering in time counts as a wrong answer
- If all 10 sudden death questions are exhausted without resolution, the game ends as-is (shared first place)
- After sudden death resolves, the normal game_over flow runs (results persisted, leaderboard updated)
- Spectators' answers during sudden death are accepted by the server but do not affect their score

### Multiplayer Results

- Ranked scoreboard with medal emojis (🥇🥈🥉) for top 3, numbered for rest
- Each row shows avatar, display name, "You" badge for current user, score/total
- Winner row has gold border highlight
- "Results recorded to leaderboard" badge (server persists all player results as TriviaWin rows, with `won=True` only for the winner(s))
- Host sees "Play Again" button → opens a settings form (pre-filled with previous game's settings) to pick new category, difficulty, question count, and max players. Submitting emits `play_again` with new settings, which resets the lobby to waiting state and brings all connected players back to the lobby view via `lobby_reset` event. The lobby code stays the same — no need to rejoin.
- Non-host players see "Waiting for host..." message on the results screen until the host starts a new round
- "Leave Lobby" button → emits `leave_lobby`, returns to browser. Available to all players.

### Solo Mode

- Same setup as the old trivia game: questions, difficulty, category dropdowns (including Country Flags). Difficulty disabled when flags selected.
- For standard categories: fetches questions client-side from `https://opentdb.com/api.php` (no WebSocket needed)
- For Country Flags: fetches all countries from `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,flags`, picks random subset, shows flag images with text input
- Gameplay: question with 4 answer buttons (standard) or flag image with text input (flags), progress dots, score badge. "Solo" badge shown in header.
- Standard questions advance after 1.2 seconds on answer. Flag questions advance after 2 seconds (to allow reading the correct answer).
- Flag answer validation uses client-side fuzzy matching with common aliases (e.g., "USA" → "United States", "UK" → "United Kingdom") and normalized comparison (strips articles, accents)
- Results: score with percentage, contextual message, progress dots
- No backend tracking — solo games do not record wins, affect the leaderboard, or count toward achievements

### Country Flags Category

Custom trivia category available in both multiplayer and solo modes. Players see a country flag image and must type the country name into a text input field.

- Data source: REST Countries API (`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`) — includes all countries and territories with flags
- Server-side: countries cached per process lifetime in `trivia_ws.py`. Questions generated by randomly selecting countries from the pool.
- Answer validation: case-insensitive fuzzy matching with common aliases (USA, UK, Holland, etc.) and normalized comparison (strips articles like "The", "Republic of", removes accents)
- Question format: `type: "flags"` field distinguishes flag questions from standard multiple-choice. `question` field contains the lowercase cca2 country code (e.g. `us`, `fr`). Client constructs the flag URL from `https://flagcdn.com/{code}.svg`. `answers` array is empty (text input, not multiple choice).
- No difficulty levels — difficulty dropdown is disabled when this category is selected
- Autocomplete dropdown: as the user types, a dropdown appears above the input showing up to 8 matching country names (substring match). Navigate with arrow keys, select with Enter or click, dismiss with Escape. Tab also accepts the highlighted suggestion. Country names are fetched once from REST Countries API and cached for the session. Works in both multiplayer and solo modes.
- Anti-cheat: flag images are fetched as blobs and displayed via blob URLs so the original URL (which could reveal the country) is hidden from DOM inspection and network tab. Right-click, drag, and text selection are disabled on flag images. The server sends only the 2-letter country code in WebSocket messages instead of the full flag URL.

## remote.meduseld.io — Remote Desktop (Peer-to-Peer Viewing & Control)

File: `meduseld-site/remote/index.html`

Peer-to-peer screen sharing page using WebRTC. Any authenticated user can host or join sessions. Video/input data flows directly between users via WebRTC; the server only handles signaling.

### Navigation

- "Back to Services" button → navigates to `https://services.meduseld.io`
- Profile widget (top-right, inside header nav bar)

### Connection Status

- Status dot indicator: connected (green), connecting (yellow), disconnected (red)
- Shown centered below the page title

### Lobby View (default)

Two action cards side by side:

1. **Share My Desktop** — triggers `getDisplayMedia()` screen capture prompt, then emits `create_session` via WebSocket. On success, switches to Host View.
2. **Join a Session** — text input for 6-character session code (auto-uppercased). Clicking "Join" or pressing Enter emits `join_session`. If host hasn't approved yet, switches to Pending View.

Active Sessions list below:

- Fetches from `GET https://health.meduseld.io/check/remote-sessions` and also receives real-time `sessions_list` broadcasts via WebSocket
- Each session card shows host name, session code badge, and viewer count
- Clicking a session card auto-fills the code and joins

### Host View

- Session code badge (clickable to copy, with Bootstrap tooltip "Click to copy")
- "OS Control" button (admin only) → emits `toggle_os_control`. When enabled, viewer input events are injected into the host OS via `xdotool` on the server (mouse, keyboard, scroll). Button shows "OS Control" (gray outline) when off, "OS Control ON" (green) when active. Requires `xdotool` to be installed on the server and a display session (`:0`). Only works when the host is sharing the server's screen. Shows error toast if xdotool is unavailable.
- Pending Requests section: shows viewer join requests with avatar, name, and Approve/Deny buttons
- Connected Viewers section: viewer chips with avatar, name, optional "CONTROL" badge, and a toggle button (lock/unlock icon with Bootstrap tooltip) to grant/revoke mouse+keyboard control per viewer
- "End Session" button → emits `end_session`, disconnects all viewers, returns to lobby
- Info text: "Your screen is being shared. Viewers see what you selected in the browser prompt."
- If the user stops screen sharing via the browser's native UI, the session ends automatically
- Screen Preview card (collapsible): shows a muted preview of the host's own shared screen with a remote cursor overlay. The cursor is a gold arrow SVG that tracks the viewer's mouse position in real-time, with a label showing the viewer's display name. Cursor shows a scale-down animation on clicks. A toggle button (eye icon) in the card header collapses/expands the preview.
- Input log bar (fixed bottom-center): briefly displays viewer actions when control is granted — click, double-click, right-click, scroll direction, and key presses with modifier combos (e.g. "Ctrl+C"). Auto-hides after 2 seconds.

### Viewer View

- Session code badge in header
- Control status badge: "View Only" (gray) or "Control Enabled" (green) — updated via `control_toggled` event
- Video element displaying the host's screen via WebRTC stream (wrapped in a `video-wrapper` div for input capture)
- "Leave" button → emits `leave_session`, returns to lobby
- When control is granted: mouse movements (throttled to ~60fps), clicks, double-clicks, right-clicks, scroll events, mousedown/mouseup (for drag), and keyboard events are captured on the video element and sent to the host via `input_event` WebSocket events. Mouse events use normalized coordinates (0-1 range). Keyboard events include modifier key state (ctrlKey, shiftKey, altKey, metaKey). Default browser actions are prevented on the video element when control is active.

### Pending View

- Spinner with "Waiting for host approval..." message
- "Cancel" button → emits `leave_session`, returns to lobby
- Switches to Viewer View on `join_approved`, or back to lobby on `join_denied`

### WebSocket Connection

- Connects to `health.meduseld.io` on the `/remote` namespace via Socket.IO
- Auth: passes `CF_Authorization` cookie value as `token` query parameter
- Server authenticates by decoding the JWT and looking up the user by Discord ID
- On connect, server emits `welcome` with `{user_id}` (DB user ID)
- Transports: polling first, then WebSocket upgrade
- Uses `health.meduseld.io` instead of `panel.meduseld.io` to avoid Cloudflare Access cross-origin session issues (health host has no Access protection; auth is handled via the JWT token in the query string)

### WebRTC

- Uses Google STUN servers (`stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`, `stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302`) for NAT traversal
- Host creates one `RTCPeerConnection` per viewer, adds local display stream tracks, sends SDP offer via signaling
- Viewer creates one `RTCPeerConnection` to host, receives SDP offer, sends answer, displays remote stream in video element
- ICE candidates exchanged via `signal` WebSocket events
- If users are behind strict NATs/firewalls, a TURN relay server may be needed (not yet configured)
