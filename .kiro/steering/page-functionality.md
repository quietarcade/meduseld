# Page Functionality Reference

## meduseld.io — Landing Page

File: `meduseld-site/index.html`

Minimal splash page with a "404 Server Not Found" joke theme.

- "Enter the Great Hall" button → navigates to `https://services.meduseld.io`
- "Looking for Herugrim?" link → navigates to `https://herugrim.meduseld.io`
- "Looking for FellowSync?" link → navigates to `https://fellowsync.meduseld.io`
- "Looking for ExSpire?" link → navigates to `https://exspire.meduseld.io`
- Footer links: quietarcade website, dynamic version badge (fetches latest release tag from GitHub API, links to release page)
- Copyright year auto-fills via JS

---

## services.meduseld.io — The Great Hall (Main Hub)

File: `meduseld-site/services/index.html`

Central navigation hub. All service cards check live status via a Cloudflare Worker health API at `https://meduseld-health.404-41f.workers.dev`. The worker first checks Cloudflare Tunnel health via the Cloudflare API, then performs individual service checks only if the tunnel is healthy. Status checks run every 5 seconds.

### Navigation & Global Elements

- "← Back to Landing" button → navigates to `https://meduseld.io`
- "Changelog" button → opens a modal with two tabs (Site and Backend). Fetches CHANGELOG.md from each GitHub repo (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) on first open, renders markdown to styled HTML. Shows spinner while loading, error message on failure.
- Discord widget (Widgetbot Crate) → embedded chat bubble in bottom-right, links to server channel `1474674474036232204`
- Speech bubble notification → appears after 3 seconds, fades after 8 seconds, says "Server suggestion or problem? Send a Discord message!"
- Profile widget (top-right, inside header nav bar) → shows avatar, display name, and Admin badge for admins. Dropdown includes: username, role, "Admin Panel" link (admin only, links to `https://admin.meduseld.io`), and Logout
- Calendar widget (centered, between page title and news panel) → shows upcoming group events fetched from `health.meduseld.io/check/calendar` (proxied through health to bypass Cloudflare Access). Displays event title, date/time, and optional description. Each event has RSVP buttons (going/maybe/not going) with counts — clicking sets your status, clicking the same status again removes it, hovering shows names of users who selected that option. Admins see a "+" button to add events (opens modal with title, date/time, description fields), edit buttons (pencil icon, opens edit modal pre-filled with event data), and delete buttons on each event. Events auto-load on page load. Auth via `cf_token` query param (GET/DELETE) or `_cf_token` in JSON body (POST/PUT).
- Copyright footer with quietarcade link and dynamic version badge (fetches latest release from GitHub API, links to release page)

### Service Cards (Active)

Each active service card has a status indicator badge that shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Offline with color coding (green/red/orange). When the Cloudflare tunnel is down, the service button becomes a link to `https://status.meduseld.io` instead of being disabled.

1. **Icarus Server (Game Server Panel)**
   - Status badge: checks panel health, shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Tunnel Down
   - "Open Control Panel" button → links to `https://panel.meduseld.io` (disabled when offline, links to status page when tunnel is down)
   - Production/Development mode toggle badge → currently hidden. When visible, click to switch between `panel.meduseld.io` and `panel.meduseld.io?env=development`. Persists in localStorage as `panelDevMode`. Shows a toast notification on toggle.
   - Game name and description are dynamically set from `CONFIG.gameName` (currently "Icarus")

2. **Edoras (Jellyfin/Media)**
   - Status badge: checks Jellyfin health via Cloudflare Worker health API, shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Tunnel Down
   - "Open Edoras" button → opens a modal with options (disabled when offline, links to status page when tunnel is down):
     - "View Library" → calls `/api/jellyfin-auth` to auto-provision a Jellyfin account and get an auth token, then navigates (same tab) to `jellyfin.meduseld.io/sso-login` which sets localStorage credentials and opens Jellyfin logged in. Falls back to navigating to Jellyfin directly if auth fails. Shows "Connecting..." spinner during auth.
     - "Request" button → links to `https://overseerr.meduseld.io` (opens in new tab)
     - "Manage" button (admin only) → links to `https://edoras.meduseld.io` Edoras management page. Shows gold "Admin" badge.
   - Description: "Stream movies, TV shows, and media from our Edoras server."
   - SSO login page (`/sso-login`): uses an iframe-first approach to avoid a race condition where Jellyfin's ConnectionManager overwrites localStorage credentials. Loads `/web/index.html` in a hidden iframe, polls localStorage every 250ms until Jellyfin initializes `jellyfin_credentials` with `Servers[0].Id`, then patches in `AccessToken`/`UserId` and redirects. Falls back to direct credential write after 15 seconds.
   - Direct visit auto-login: when a user visits `jellyfin.meduseld.io` directly with a valid `CF_Authorization` cookie, an injected script automatically calls `/api/jellyfin-auth`, then polls localStorage waiting for Jellyfin's ConnectionManager to initialize credentials before patching in the auth token. Uses `sessionStorage` flag to prevent retry loops (one attempt per session).

3. **FellowSync (Spotify Listening Rooms)**
   - Custom icon: `fellowsync-bi.png`
   - "Open FellowSync" button → links to `https://fellowsync.meduseld.io`
   - Description: "One does not simply listen alone..."
   - No status badge (external app, not health-checked)

4. **The Red Book (E-books & Audiobooks)**
   - "Open The Red Book" button → links to `https://redbook.meduseld.io`
   - Description: "Browse and listen to e-books and audiobooks from our collection."
   - No status badge (external app, not health-checked)

  - Gray: process health checks, expected process monitor messages (after user stop/kill/idle shutdown)
- Visual separators for: SERVER START, SERVER STOP INITIATED, SERVER STOPPED, IDLE SHUTDOWN, SERVER KILLED, SERVER CRASHED, PROCESS DIED UNEXPECTEDLY
- The stop, kill, and idle shutdown actions write markers to `startup.log` ("User stop:", "User kill:", "Idle shutdown:") so the panel can distinguish intentional shutdowns from unexpected process deaths. When the process monitor detects the server is gone, it checks the preceding log lines for these markers — if found, the event is shown as a quiet gray line; if not, it shows the red "💥 PROCESS DIED UNEXPECTEDLY" separator.

### CPU & RAM Charts

- Two Chart.js line graphs side by side
- Each has two datasets: System (gold) and Server/Icarus (green)
- CPU chart: System CPU % and Server CPU %

## admin.meduseld.io — User Management (Admin Only)

File: `meduseld-site/admin/index.html`

Static admin page for managing user roles and account status. Served by Cloudflare Pages independently of the Flask backend. Non-admin users are redirected to `services.meduseld.io?restricted=user-management`.

### Navigation

- "Back to Services" button → navigates to `https://services.meduseld.io`
- Profile widget (top-right, inside header nav bar)

### Users Table

- Fetches from `GET https://panel.meduseld.io/api/admin/users` with credentials
- "Refresh" button → re-fetches user list
- Columns: User (avatar + display name), Discord ID, Role, Services, Last Login, Actions
- Services column shows a purple Jellyfin icon if the user has Jellyfin credentials (`has_jellyfin`), dash otherwise
- Current user row shows a "You" badge
- Inactive users shown at 50% opacity
- Users sorted: admins first, then alphabetically by display name
- Users without a custom Discord avatar show Discord's default avatar (colored Discord logo) instead of a generic icon

### Actions Per User (not available on own account)

- Promote/Demote button → `PUT /api/admin/users/<id>` with `{role: "admin"}` or `{role: "user"}`
- Activate/Deactivate button → `PUT /api/admin/users/<id>` with `{is_active: true}` or `{is_active: false}`
- Toast notifications on success/failure

### Backend Offline State

- If the Flask backend is unreachable, the table shows "Backend is offline. Unable to load users."
- User count badge shows "Backend Offline" in red
- If the `CF_Authorization` cookie is invalid or expired (401/403), shows "Authentication failed" with a suggestion to log out and back in. User count badge shows "Auth Error" in yellow.
- API calls are routed through `health.meduseld.io/check/team-roster` to bypass Cloudflare Access session requirements. The endpoint is named "team-roster" instead of "admin-users" to avoid ad-blocker false positives (filter lists block URLs containing "admin"). Auth is handled by reading the `CF_Authorization` cookie via JS and passing its value as a `cf_token` query parameter (GET) or `_cf_token` in the JSON body (PUT). This avoids both Cloudflare cookie interception and CORS preflight issues. Flask's `_authenticate_from_cookie()` decodes the token from cookie, header, query param, or body.

### Admin Tools Section

Below the users table, an "Admin Tools" section displays service cards for admin-only services. These were moved here from the services page since they are only relevant to admins.

1. **SSH Access**
   - Status badge: checks SSH health via Cloudflare Worker health API (`https://meduseld-health.404-41f.workers.dev`), polls every 5 seconds
   - Shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Tunnel Down with color coding (green/red/orange)
   - "Open SSH Terminal" button → links to `https://ssh.meduseld.io` (disabled when offline, links to status page when tunnel is down)

2. **System Monitor**
   - Always shows "Online" badge (static page, always available)
   - "Open System Monitor" button → links to `https://system.meduseld.io`
