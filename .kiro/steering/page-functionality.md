# Page Functionality Reference

## meduseld.io — Landing Page

File: `meduseld-site/index.html`

Minimal splash page with a "404 Server Not Found" joke theme.

- "Enter the Great Hall" button → navigates to `https://services.meduseld.io`
- Footer links: quietarcade website, GitHub repo (version badge)
- Copyright year auto-fills via JS

---

## services.meduseld.io — The Great Hall (Main Hub)

File: `meduseld-site/services/index.html`

Central navigation hub. All service cards check live status via a Cloudflare Worker health API at `https://meduseld-health.404-41f.workers.dev`. Status checks run every 5 seconds.

### Navigation & Global Elements

- "← Back to Landing" button → navigates to `https://meduseld.io`
- "Changelog" button → opens a modal (content placeholder, says "coming soon")
- Discord widget (Widgetbot Crate) → embedded chat bubble in bottom-right, links to server channel `1474674474036232204`
- Speech bubble notification → appears after 3 seconds, fades after 8 seconds, says "Server suggestion or problem? Send a Discord message!"
- Profile widget (top-right, inside header nav bar) → shows avatar, display name, and Admin badge for admins. Dropdown includes: username, role, "Admin Panel" link (admin only, links to `https://admin.meduseld.io`), and Logout
- Copyright footer with quietarcade link and version badge

### Service Cards (Active)

Each active service card has a status indicator badge that shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Offline with color coding (green/red/orange).

1. **Icarus Server (Game Server Panel)**
   - Status badge: checks panel health, shows Online/Offline/Cloudflare Tunnel Down
   - "Open Control Panel" button → links to `https://panel.meduseld.io` (disabled when offline)
   - Production/Development mode toggle badge → currently hidden. When visible, click to switch between `panel.meduseld.io` and `panel.meduseld.io?env=development`. Persists in localStorage as `panelDevMode`. Shows a toast notification on toggle.
   - Game name and description are dynamically set from `CONFIG.gameName` (currently "Icarus")

2. **Edoras (Jellyfin/Media)**
   - Status badge: checks jellyfin health
   - "Open Edoras" button → opens a modal with two options (disabled when offline):
     - "View Library" → calls `/api/jellyfin-auth` to auto-provision a Jellyfin account and get an auth token, then navigates (same tab) to `jellyfin.meduseld.io/sso-login` which sets localStorage credentials and opens Jellyfin logged in. Falls back to navigating to Jellyfin directly if auth fails. Shows "Connecting..." spinner during auth.
     - "Request" dropdown → "Movies" links to `https://radarr.meduseld.io`, "TV Shows" links to `https://sonarr.meduseld.io` (both open in new tab)
   - SSO login page (`/sso-login`): uses an iframe-first approach to avoid a race condition where Jellyfin's ConnectionManager overwrites localStorage credentials. Loads `/web/index.html` in a hidden iframe, polls localStorage every 250ms until Jellyfin initializes `jellyfin_credentials` with `Servers[0].Id`, then patches in `AccessToken`/`UserId` and redirects. Falls back to direct credential write after 15 seconds.
   - Direct visit auto-login: when a user visits `jellyfin.meduseld.io` directly with a valid `CF_Authorization` cookie, an injected script automatically calls `/api/jellyfin-auth`, then polls localStorage waiting for Jellyfin's ConnectionManager to initialize credentials before patching in the auth token. Uses `sessionStorage` flag to prevent retry loops (one attempt per session).

3. **SSH Access** (Admin only — hidden for non-admin users)
   - Gold "Admin" badge below card title
   - Status badge: checks SSH health
   - "Open SSH Terminal" button → links to `https://ssh.meduseld.io` (disabled when offline)

4. **System Monitor** (Admin only — hidden for non-admin users)
   - Gold "Admin" badge below card title
   - Always shows "Active" badge (static page, always available)
   - "Open System Monitor" button → links to `https://system.meduseld.io`
